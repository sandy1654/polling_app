# polling_app
In my project titled Flask Polling App, I integrated AWS services, specifically AWS Lambda, to enhance the appâ€™s scalability and eliminate the need for server management. The core idea behind this integration was to offload specific backend processes, like vote processing, to AWS Lambda, making the app serverless and efficient.
